This project is run on windows 10, using Python 3.6.3.
The Flask, request and Radon modules are used and require a virtual environment installation.
This project requires a git token to gain access to the repository's whose cyclomatic complexity is being calculated.
To gain a token, go to github, settings and generate a new token from the developer settings. Create a text file called 'git-token.txt' in the same directory as the worker and master codes, and paste this token to the 'git-token.txt' file.
To run the manager.py - python manager.py (the number of workers used is set to eight)
To run the workers, compile the cmd script which will set eight worker.py's to work
